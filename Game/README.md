Peace-Out

This is my personal version of Break-out/Arkanoid. I wanted to make it colorful, fun, and exciting. I utilized PhysicsJS as my engine and I must say, I highly recommend it for games such as this. For now we have two levels. The controls are a simple left arrow and right arrow to move. Spacebar starts the game. The player has three lives. Upon Game Over, the player can still start a new game from their last played level albeit with the bricks back to where they originally were.

Do feel free to pull this repository and let me know if you can do it better. I welcome all input. :-) Cheers!
